This topic describes an issue with object ownership for PostgreSQL.

When a developer binds a PostgreSQL service instance to an application the broker
creates a distinct role with unique credentials. The broker ensures all the
distinct roles are members of a group named `binding_group`.

Members of this group have full privileges to objects created by other members.
This does not include the ability to `DROP` or `ALTER` objects.

For more information about defining access priviledges,
see [GRANT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-grant.html)
in the PostgreSQL documentation.

For members of `binding_group` to `ALTER` or `DROP` an object,
you must assign the group's role before creating an object:

<pre class="terminal">
$ SET ROLE binding_group;
</pre>

After this is done, you can continue with your actions.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ SET ROLE binding_group;
$ CREATE TABLE data
</pre>

For more information about setting the current user identifier of the current session,
see [SET ROLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-set-role.html)
in the PostgreSQL documentation.
