## How the branches here work

Use **master** for next the unreleased version, and numbered branches for the corresponding live releases. For example:

| Branch name | Use forâ€¦ |
|-------------| ------|
| master      | Currently the live 1.4.5 branch | http://docs.pivotal.io/aws-services/ |
| v1.5.0         | edge | https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/aws-services/1-5/ |
| v1.10         | obsolete, (need to verify before we delete the branch) | Related to OpsMan Version? |
| v1.8        | obsolete, (need to verify before we delete the branch) | Related to OpsMan Version? |
| v1.6      | obsolete, (need to verify before we delete the branch) | Related to OpsMan Version? |

Ideally once the branches are cleaned up, "master" will be the current live version.
At the momenth, 1.5.0 is the edge branch with the most current information, and will eventually be merged into master.
