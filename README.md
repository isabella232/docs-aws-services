## How the branches here work

| Branch name | Use for… | Currently lives…
|-------------| ------| ------|
| master      | Currently the published 1.4.8 docs. Contains all changes for v1.4. | http://docs.pivotal.io/aws-services/ |
| 1.5         | Currently Edge. Contains all changes made to v1.4, as well as additional work for EMR. v1.5 is in "sustain mode". There is no plan for its release. However, when making changes to v1.4, cherry-pick those changes to 1.5 as well! | https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/aws-services/1-5/ |
