##<a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Service Broker for AWS gives app developers
the ability to create and manage Amazon Web Services (AWS) products,
such as database services and S3 storage, from the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

Service Broker for AWS exposes the selected AWS products in the Marketplace.
App developers then create and manage a service instance using the cf CLI commands `create service`, `bind service`, `unbind service`, and `delete service`.
After obtaining a service key using the `create-service-key` command,
developers can use the key with the AWS CLI to perform additional operations as permitted by the PCF operator.
