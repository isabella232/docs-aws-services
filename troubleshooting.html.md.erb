##Tile Deployment Token ID Error
As a PCF operator, when deploying the tile by clicking **Apply Changes**, I get the following error:<br>
<em>"A client error (InvalidClientTokenId) occurred when calling the GetUser operation: The security token included in the request is invalid.</em>"

**Reason:**<br>
The AWS credentials are not valid. Please recheck them or recreate the credentials.


##Unable to Remove the AWS Broker
As a PCF operator, when deleting the product tile, I get the following error:<br>
<em>"Can not remove brokers that have associated service instances"</em>.

**Reason:**<br>
Your service broker currently has service instances that are active. They must be deleted before the tile can be deleted.


##Service Creation Token ID Error
As a developer, when trying to create a service, I get the following error:<br>
<em>"Service broker error: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid."</em>

**Reason:**<br>
The AWS credentials are not valid. Please ask your PCF operator to recheck them or recreate the credentials.
