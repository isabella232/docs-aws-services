---

This topic provides basic troubleshooting techniques and FAQs for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Service Broker for AWS.

## Problem
As a PCF operator, when deploying the tile by clicking **Apply Changes**,
I get the following error:
"A client error (InvalidClientTokenId) occurred when calling the GetUser operation:
The security token included in the request is invalid."

### Reason
The AWS credentials are not valid. Recheck them or recreate the credentials.


## Problem
As a PCF operator, when deleting the product tile, I get the following error:
"Can not remove brokers that have associated service instances".

### Reason
Your service broker currently has service instances that are active.
They must be deleted before the tile can be deleted.


## Problem
As a developer, when trying to create a service, I get the following error:
"Service broker error: InvalidClientTokenId:
The security token included in the request is invalid."

### Reason
The AWS credentials are not valid.
Ask your PCF operator to recheck them or recreate the credentials.
