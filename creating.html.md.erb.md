title: Creating and Managing Service Instances
---

##<a id="overview"></a>Overview

This topic describes how developers set up, operate, and scale Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources from Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) by creating and managing service instances using the Service Broker for AWS.

PCF operators must follow the instructions in [Installing the Service Broker](installation.html) to install the Service Broker for AWS before developers can use it.
During installation, operators configure which AWS services they want to make available to developers in the Marketplace.
They can also set up pre-defined service plans with specific resource configurations and securely manage their AWS credentials.

The current version of the Service Broker for AWS supports the following services:

  * Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for 
      - PostgreSQL
      - MySQL
      - MariaDB
      - SQL Server
      - Oracle Database
  * Amazon Aurora
  * Amazon DynamoDB
  * Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
  * Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
  * Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)

Developers create and manage service instances of the Service Broker for AWS through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) or Apps Manager.

To perform the following procedures for creating and managing service instances, a developer must be logged in to the PCF deployment via the cf CLI.

##<a id="create"></a>Create Service Instances

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When installing the Service Broker for AWS,
   the PCF operator sets up an IAM account and policy and provides credentials to the Service Broker.
   Developers do not need access to the credentials to create service instances.
   For information about installing, see <a href="installation.html">Installing the Service Broker</a>.</p>

###<a id="rds"></a>RDS for PostgreSQL

To create a service instance of the RDS for PostgreSQL service, use `cf create-service` to create an instance of `aws-rds-postgres` with or without custom settings.

</pre>

###<a id="aurora"></a>Amazon Aurora

To create a service instance of the Amazon Aurora service, use `cf create-service` to create an instance of `aws-rds-aurora` with or without custom settings.

To create an instance of `aws-rds-aurora` without custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE`. The following example creates an instance named `auroradb1` with the `standard` plan:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-rds-aurora standard auroradb1
</pre>

To create an instance of `aws-rds-aurora` with custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE` with the `-c` flag and provide custom settings for the following elements:

  * Multi-AZ
  * AvailabilityZone

The following example shows the syntax for each setting. You can omit settings you don't want to explicitly set:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-rds-aurora basic auroradb2 -c '{ "CreateDbInstance": { "MultiAZ": false, "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a", "Tags": [{"Key": "owner", "Value": "operations"}, {"Key": "Env", "Value": "staging"} ] } }'
</pre>

###<a id="dynamodb"></a>Amazon DynamoDB

You can create and add items to NoSQL tables with DynamoDB. You can do this programmatically or through the [AWS DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1). Pivotal recommends creating an IAM user at bind time and configuring access to a set of prefixed tables for operations such as creating a table and adding an item. 

To create a service instance of the AWS DynamoDB service, use `cf create-service` to create an instance of `aws-dynamodb`.

To create an instance of `aws-dynamodb`, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE`. The following example creates an instance named `mydynamodb` with the `standard` plan:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-dynamodb standard MYDYNAMODB</pre>

Binding an app to a DynamoDB service instance creates an IAM User that can create tables with a prefix corresponding to the guid of the service instance. You can find the credentials to create DynamoDB tables programatically in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable of the app that service is bound to, along with the table prefix and region. For example:

<pre class="json">
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "aws-dynamodb": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
     "prefix": "0110c45b-e0be-4b05-8aa5-7bafd5866dff_",
     "region": "us-east-1",
     "secret_access_key": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
    },
    "label": "aws-dynamodb",
    "name": "mydynamodb",
    "plan": "standard",
    "provider": null,
   }
  ]
 }
}
</pre>

The tables you create are only accessible from the app that service is bound to. Each bind creates an IAM user with full DynamoDB permissions on only the prefixed tables, for example `arn:aws:dynamodb:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:table/PREFIX_*`.

###<a id="s3"></a>Amazon S3

To create a S3 bucket, use `cf create-service` to create an instance of `aws-s3` with or without custom settings.

To create an S3 bucket without custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE`. The following example creates an instance named `bucket1` with the `standard` plan:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-s3 standard bucket1
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: S3 service instances use default region and tags settings configured by the PCF operator during the installation of the Service Broker for AWS.</p>

To create an S3 bucket with custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE` with the `-c` flag. For instance, you can use custom settings to create a bucket in a specific region to lower latency for users. The following example  creates a bucket in the Tokyo region with tag values k1=v1:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf cs aws-s3 standard tokyobucket -c '{ "CreateBucket": { "CreateBucketConfiguration": { "LocationConstraint": "ap-northeast-1"} }, "PutBucketTagging": { "Tagging":{ "TagSet": [ {"Key" : "k1", "Value": "v1"}]}} }'</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Developers can supply additional configuration parameters to service instances at update and bind times.</p>

###<a id="sqs"></a>Amazon SQS

To create an SQS queue, use `cf create-service` to create an instance of `aws-sqs` with or without custom settings.

To create an SQS bucket without custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE`. The following example creates an instance named `queue1` with the `standard` plan:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-sqs standard queue1
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: SQS queue instances use default region and property settings configured by the PCF operator during the installation of the Service Broker for AWS.</p>

To create an SQS queue with custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE` with the `-c` flag. For instance, you can use custom settings to create a queue with a specific name and maximum message size. The following example creates a queue named "kb-queue" with a 1kb max message size:

<pre class="terminal">$ cf cs aws-sqs standard kbqueue -c '{ "CreateQueue": {  "QueueName": "kb-queue", "Attributes": { "MaximumMessageSize": "1024"} } }'</pre>

###<a id="emr"></a>Amazon EMR

To create an EMR cluster, use `cf create-service` to create an instance of `aws-emr` with or without custom settings.

To create an EMR cluster without custom settings, use `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE`. The following example creates an instance named `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the `standard` plan:

<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-emr standard SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME;
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: EMR cluster instances use default region and property settings configured by the PCF operator during the installation of the Service Broker for AWS.</p>

Additional configuration parameters for EMR can be specified with the `-c` flag with `cf create-service`.

<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service aws-emr standard SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c config.json;
</pre>

<strong>Sample config.json file</strong>

<pre class="json">
{
  "Applications": [
    "Hadoop",
    "HBase",
    "Pig"
  ],
  "ApplicationConfigs": [{
    "Classification": "some-classification",
    "Properties": {
      "some-property-key": "some-property-value"
    },
    "Configurations": []
  }],
  "BootstrapActions": [{
    "Name": "some-bootstrap-action-name",
    "Path": "s3://some-bucket/path/to/script.sh",
    "Args": ["arg1", "arg2"]
  }],
  "Ec2KeyName": "some-ec2-keypair-name",
  "S3LogUri": "s3://some-s3-log-bucket"
}
</pre>

You can create your config.json using a number of different variables. The following table lists the **Keys** that you can use to configure your EMR cluster.

<table class="nice">
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Required</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <tr><td><strong>Applications</strong></td>
                <td>string list</td>
                <td>no</td>
                <td>List of applications to install (e.g. "Pig", "HBase"). <br><br>For more information about supported applications for EMR release versions, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-release-components.html#emr-release-applications" rel="nofollow">About Amazon EMR Releases.</a>.</td>

        <tr><td><strong>Ec2KeyName</strong></td>
                <td>string</td>
                <td>no</td>
                <td>Name of an existing EC2 key pair that is used for SSH access.</td>
        </tr>

        </tr>
</table>

An example of configuring an application is shown below using HBase. To configure HBase to use an S3 bucket as a root directory, use the following snippet for the <strong>ApplicationConfigs</strong> portion of the config.json:

<pre class="json">
"ApplicationConfigs": [{
    "Classification": "hbase-site",
    "Properties": {
      "hbase.rootdir": "s3://your-hbase-root-directory-bucket"
    }
  }, {
    "Classification": "hbase",
    "Properties": {
      "hbase.emr.storageMode": "s3"
    }
  }]
</pre>

##<a id="bind"></a>Bind or Unbind a Service Instance

Binding an RDS database or S3 service instance to an app:

* Grants the app access to the RDS database or S3 bucket.
* Provides credentials in the environment variables.

Access permissions applied by the bind operation are set at the lowest level.

Run the following command to bind a service instance to an app:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When binding to an RDS database, a new user and password is created for the binding.
   Oracle is an exception to this rule, where bound apps are provided with the master username and password. </p>

Unbinding a service instance from an app removes access to the database and removes database credentials from the environment variables.

Run the following command to unbind a service instance to an app:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf unbind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE</pre>


##<a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before deleting a service instance, ensure there are no apps bound to the service instance.</p>
Run the following command to delete a service instance:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf delete-service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
Really delete the service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE> y
Deleting service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE in org system / space dev1 as appdev1...
OK
Delete in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE' to check operation status.
</pre>


##<a id="servicekeys"></a>Using Service Keys with AWS
Service keys provide credentials for manually configuring consumers of marketplace services. 
App developers can use these keys to perform tasks against the underlying resource using the AWS CLI. 
These tasks are defined by the Operator using service key policy templates.

Run the following command to create a service key for a service instance:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service-key YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY-NAME</pre>

This command creates a service key for "YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE" named "SERVICE-KEY-NAME".

To view the corresponding credentials, run the following command:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf service-key YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY-NAME</pre>

This returns credentials in JSON format, containing the Access Key ID and Secret, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the underlying resource in AWS. For example, service key credentials for an S3 bucket would return the following:

<pre class="terminal">
{
 "access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
 "arn": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
 "secret_access_key": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}
</pre>

**EMR Config** introduced in v1.5.0 does not use ARNs, so the cluster ID is returned instead:

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "cluster_id": "the-emr-cluster-id",
  "master_public_dns_name": "the-public-dns-name-for-master-node",
  "region": "some-aws-region",
  "access_key_id": "some-access-key-id",
  "secret_access_key": "some-secret-access-key"
}
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a service key, a new IAM user is created with a policy defined by the Operator.
   This policy can be configured to optionally time out after a time period specified by the Operator.</p>

###Delete Service Key

In addition to removing access to the service instance, 
deleting a service key also deletes the underlying IAM user.

Run the following command to delete the service key:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf delete-service-key YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY-NAME</pre>

For more information about Service Keys, see [Managing Service Keys](https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/1-12/devguide/services/service-keys.html).

##<a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

###Problem

As a PCF operator, when deploying the tile by clicking **Apply Changes**, I get the following error: "A client error (InvalidClientTokenId) occurred when calling the GetUser operation: The security token included in the request is invalid."

####Reason
The AWS credentials are not valid, please recheck them or recreate the credentials.

###Problem

As a PCF operator, when deleting the product tile, I get the following error: "Can not remove brokers that have associated service instances".

####Reason

Your service broker currently has service instances that are active. They must be deleted before the tile can be deleted.

###Problem

As a developer, when trying to create a service, I get the following error: "Service broker error: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid."

####Reason
The AWS credentials are not valid, please ask your PCF operator to recheck them or recreate the credentials.
